            <!--Description of the dish-->
            <p>Arepas are fried cornmeal pockets stuffed with all the fillings you could ever want, like carnitas, spicy chicken, sweet potatoes, black beans, sauces, and more.</p>

            <h1>Ingredients</h1>

            <!--Adding List of Ingredients-->
            <ul>
                <li>2 and a half cups of lukewarm water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
                <li>2 cups of pre-cooled white cornmeal</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            </ul>

            <!--Adding Steps-->
            <h1>Steps</h1>

            <ol>
                <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
                <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
                <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
